# Lab 4
This lab is introductory to actually working with the arduino and an osciloscope.
## Objectives
1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Learn the basic tools available for debugging embedded software
3. Learn the basics of GPIO using both library functions, and register-level port manipulation
## Org
You may notice that this is organized a bit strangely - that is because Arduino wants each sketch to be in a different file primarily.
